== About
This is currently only a *draft/proof of concept*. The plugin has only test action inside, only the class
`DrawIoLocalStorageExample` does something relevant!

When starting `DrawIoLocalStorageExample` it is a simple java programm and can be started 
directly. It loads a changed variant of 
https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-integration/blob/master/localstorage-svg.html 
with some additional hooks inside.

SWT browser will open changed file. You can edit and do drawio stuff.
Then doing a "save" will store data in localstorage - additionally xml message 
content will be shown in Java System out by callback...
